# Platformer-Game
A 2D pixel-style platformer game for my EPQ, built using Python and Pygame. <br><br>

To **run the game**, run `platformer_upgraded.py`.

Game **map info** are stored in `level_0.json` and `level_1.json`. To **edit the game map**, run `editor.py` and change `Editor.name` into the targeted map name (a new json file will be created if the file doesn't already exist).

**Sprites, sound tracks** and other assets are stored in the folder `platformer_assets`.

Other Python files such as `handle_collision`, `objects` and `tilemap` are **helper modules** of the main game.
